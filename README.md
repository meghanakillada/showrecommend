# HELLOWORLD

## Python Basics
[firstfile.py](https://github.com/maggie3000/helloworld/blob/main/helloworld/firstfile.py)

## Mini Lab
[fibonacci.py](https://github.com/maggie3000/helloworld/blob/main/helloworld/fibonacci.py)
### Instructions:
Demo on Web:
1. Runtime Demo of Class in action with Web front end.
BluePrint Location (Console)
2. The Fibonacci Algorithm code in a Python BluePrint directory.
Run in Console
3. Running Fib in Console, versus Web and breaking down interactions with Object.
Code (algorithm) 
4. Discuss Class __init__ (Java calls this constructor). This sets up a calculates all Fibonacci data.
Who can find a way to change the Fibonacci series?
5. Discuss Class "getters". These provide interface to allow you to get data out of the Object.
Code (route)
6. Review Object initializing and passing data  to HTML/Jinja. This passes nth value to __init__ and returns an Object.
Code (html/thymeleaf)
7. Referencing "getters" in Jinja and the second in function style.
8. Conclude with Input and Output and "the Series".  Who can make the area for the series bigger?
Outcome:  Individual Mini-Lab using "Class(es) and Object(s)
1. Use an individual section (blueprint) in your Scrum Team project for Mini Lab definition and execution.
2. Enhance or Define a Class to manage a complex data set
3. Create an Object from a Class in Python. 
4. Display data or enhanced data from this Python Object on a Web Page using "getters".
5. Highlight WOW or insight in doing this project.  (ie Mastery Show adding timing to Class to Displaying it on Web)
